# Adding Your Medical Analyzer Code to GitHub

Since Git isn't installed on your system, you can use the GitHub web interface to upload your code. Here's how:

## Method 1: GitHub Web Interface Upload

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**:
   - Navigate to https://github.com/Sidhtang/medpassport in your browser

2. **Create or update files**:
   - Click on the "Add file" button (top right)
   - Select "Upload files" or "Create new file"
   - For uploading: drag and drop files or use the file selector
   - For creating: paste the code and name the file

3. **Commit your changes**:
   - Add a commit message (e.g., "Add Medical Analyzer application")
   - Optionally add a description
   - Click "Commit changes"

4. **Limitations**:
   - GitHub web interface has file size limits (usually 25MB per file)
   - Uploading folders is not directly supported (you'll need to create directories manually)
   - Large numbers of files need to be uploaded in batches

## Method 2: GitHub Desktop

If using the command line is difficult, GitHub Desktop provides a GUI alternative:

1. **Download GitHub Desktop**:
   - Go to https://desktop.github.com/ and download the installer
   - Install the application

2. **Sign in to GitHub**:
   - Open GitHub Desktop
   - Sign in with your GitHub credentials

3. **Clone your repository**:
   - Click on "Clone a repository"
   - Select "Sidhtang/medpassport"
   - Choose a local path and click "Clone"

4. **Add files**:
   - Copy all files from "c:\Users\pc\Pictures\Saved Pictures\medical-analyzer" to the cloned repository folder

5. **Commit and push**:
   - GitHub Desktop will show all changed files
   - Add a summary (e.g., "Add Medical Analyzer application")
   - Click "Commit to main"
   - Click "Push origin"

## Method 3: Install Git

For future reference, installing Git would make this process much easier:

1. **Download Git**:
   - Go to https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - Download the appropriate installer

2. **Install Git**:
   - Run the installer
   - Use the default options (or customize as needed)
   - Make sure to select "Add Git to PATH" during installation

3. **Restart your computer**:
   - This ensures Git is properly added to your PATH

4. **After installation**:
   - Open PowerShell or Command Prompt
   - Run `git --version` to verify the installation
   - Then follow the Git commands described earlier to push your code
